# Bike Store Sales Analysis

## Table of Contents

### Project Overview
---
This data analysis project was carried out to help me improve my SQL querying skills. It also aims to provide insights into the sales performance of stores that sell a variety of bikes. By identifying purchase trends in customers and products, data-driven decisions and recommendations can be made as well as acquiring an understanding of store performances. 

### Potential Questions
---
After browsing through the data, some interesting question groupings that can provide clarity initially came to my mind:
1. Sales and Revenue Analysis 
2. Product and Inventory Analysis
3. Customer Behavior and Order Analysis
4. Staff and Store Analysis
5. Product Category and Brand Analysis

**N.B**: More questions wered be added and answered when the data is queried

### Skills Demonstrated
---
- Writing functional & efficient SQL queries

### Data Sources
---
The data used for the analysis can be found in the Data folder in csv files.

### Tool(s) Used
---
- MySQL

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
---
The data was already relatively clean and ready to use. I simply added the NULL keyword to empty cells to avoid any problems while importing the csv files into MySQL.

## Data Analysis
This section covers a glimpse of some of the queries I wrote to answer the questions I had to draw out important insights.
