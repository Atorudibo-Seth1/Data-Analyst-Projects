# Description
This is a repository for my Data Analytics Projects primarily using tools such as Microsoft Excel, MySQL and Python. It features the work done as well as an in-depth analysis report for each project which highlights my thought process and steps taken to complete my analysis. 

The repository is broken down into the 4 parts:
- **SQL Projects**: Projects here were done primarily with SQL as a means to improve my skills in writing efficient and functional queries.
- **Excel Projects**: Projects here were done primarily with Microsoft Excel as a means to improve my skills in Excel which include mastering functions, features and creating visualisations.
- **PY projects**: Projects here were done primarily with Python as a means to improve my skills in data cleaning, exploration and visualisations.
- **Combination Projects**: As the name implies, projects here were done primarily using a combination of at least 2 data analysis tools as means to give me a holistic data analyst experience.

I also have a dedicated Tableau profile for visualisation projects I've done. Feel free to check out my visualisations and dashboards [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/seth.atorudibo).
