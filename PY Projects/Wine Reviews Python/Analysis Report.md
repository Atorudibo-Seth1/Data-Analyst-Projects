### Project Overview
---
This is a data analysis project done using Python with the aim of improving my data cleaning, exploration and visualisation skills using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. It also aims to provide insights into the ratings of wines, prices, wineries and so on.

### Exploratory Questions
---
The aim was to ask insightful questions that could provide more information for the analysis:
1. What are the top 10 highest-rated wines in the dataset?
2. How many wines were produced by each winery?
3. Top 10 countries with the highest average wine prices.
4. Is there a relationship between wine ratings (points) and prices?
5. What are the countries with the best rated wines?

### Skills Demonstrated
---
- Problem Solving
- Critical Thinking

### Data Sources
---
The data used can be found in the zip folder.

### Tools Used
---
- Jupyter Notebooks

### Data Cleaning
---
- Checking for nulls and duplicates and dropping them where necessary.
- Filling nulls with appropriate types

## Data Analysis
This section covers a glimpse of some of the code I wrote as well as some screenshots and a brief summary of the general findings I was able to extract through my analysis. 

**N.B**: The complete code and visualisations can be found in the [Wine_Reviews.ipynb](Wine_Reviews.ipynb) file
