### Project Overview
---
This is a data analysis project done using Python with the aim of improving my data cleaning, exploration and visualisation skills using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. It also aims to provide insights into the sales and profit performances of a fictional superstore that sells various items. By understanding the patterns that exist within the data through proper analysis, appropriate recommendations were made that could potentially improve profitability.
### Exploratory Questions
---
The aim was to add further insightful questions that stem from these groups that could provide more information for the analysis:
1. Sales & Profits From Customers
2. Product Performances
3. Regional Sales & Profits
4. Discount Impact on Sales & Profits
5. Category/Subcategory Performances
6. Ship Mode & Shipping durations
### Skills Demonstrated
