### Recommendations
---
Based on some of my findings, here are some recommendations I would offer:

1. **Focus on Expanding in the United States:**
   Given that the United States has the highest total sales, consider concentrating marketing efforts and resources on expanding and optimizing operations in the U.S. Identify specific strategies to attract more customers or increase sales in this region, such as targeted promotions, loyalty programs, or market-specific offerings.

2. **Customer Engagement with High Spenders:**
   Develop a customer engagement strategy to retain and potentially increase spending from high-value customers like Alis Wilmore. Consider implementing a personalized loyalty program, sending exclusive offers, or seeking feedback to enhance the overall customer experience. Strengthening relationships with top spenders can contribute significantly to overall sales growth.

3. **Diversify Coffee Offerings:**
   Recognizing the popularity of Liberica, Arabica, and Excelsa, explore opportunities to diversify the coffee menu further. Introduce new coffee blends or variations to attract a broader customer base and potentially increase sales. Conduct market research to understand local preferences in each country and tailor offerings accordingly. This strategy can help tap into different segments of the market and enhance overall product appeal.
