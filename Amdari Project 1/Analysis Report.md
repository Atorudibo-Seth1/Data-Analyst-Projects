### Project Overview
---
This project aims to use the art of utilising Microsoft Excel to streamline and perfect order fulfilment within supply chain operations.
### Exploratory Questions
---
Here are some questions that served as a guide for insights:
1. What is the overall customer satisfaction rate?
2. How many orders are still backlogged?
3. What are the various performances in terms of logistics i.e Drivers and vehicular performances?
4. What is the order completion rate?
5. How long does do delivery take on average as well as delay averages and impact?

### Skills Demonstrated
---
- Using Office Scripts for KPI automation and ad-hoc reporting.
- Creating interactive dashboards
- Using Pivot Tables, slicers etc.
- Critical Thinking and Problem Solving

### Data Sources
---
The data is contained in the [DeliveryOptimisation.xlsx](DeliveryOptimisation.xlsx) file along with the dashboard.
### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel
### Data Cleaning
---
- Checking for duplicates
- Addressing empty cells in certian columns
- Fixing date and other datatypes
## Data Analysis

As seen in the above image, is the interactive dashboard. It contains several KPIs that serve as indicators for important metrics. It also contains slicers that allow the charts to filtered accordingly and reflect the data of the selected button.

### Findings
---
- The average delivery time for an order is about 152 minutes while the average delay incured for an order is 14.5 minutes.
- The current overall customer satisfaction rate is about 32% which is pretty low and below average.
- Bike C is the vehicle incurring the highest delays on average.
- About 49% of orders have been completed at the moment.
- There are currently more orders in backlog than orders that have been completed.
- Route 3 is associated with the highest delays and Route 5 is the lowest.
- Orders with expedited rules are associated with the highest average delays.
  
### Recommendations
---
Based on some of my findings, here are some recommendations I would offer:

1. **Address Delays Across Routes and Vehicles:**
   Conduct detailed analyses of Route 3 and Route 5 to replicate the efficiency factors of Route 5 in other routes. Also diversify or upgrade the fleet if Bike C consistently underperforms compared to other vehicles.

2. **Increase Order Completion Rate:**
   Establish a short-term target to increase the current completion rate from 49% to at least about 70% within a defined period. 

3. **Reassess Expedited Rules:**
   Orders with expedited rules have the highest delays, indicating inefficiency in their processing. Review and streamline these rules for better performance. Limit the number of expedited orders to ensure that they donâ€™t overload available resources.

4. **Address the Backlog Issue:**
   Increase resources (e.g., drivers or vehicles) for orders in backlog while maintaining a balance for ongoing deliveries. Implement a dynamic priority system to ensure older backlogged orders are addressed first.
